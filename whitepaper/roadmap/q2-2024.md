# Q2 2024 (and before)
1. **Create a Canister Development Kit (CDK)** ✅  
Written in Rust, the CDK will be used by game developers to port current games or to create new ones to be published on the platform.

2. **Implement the backend** ✅  
Written in Rust, totally independent of games and NFT's published, it should handle user accounts, register games and NFTs, and schedule matches and keep track of the results.

3. **Implement the frontend UI** ✅  
Written in Typescript, it should be a responsive, mobile-first site, allowing user to logon with Internet Identity or Plug wallet.

4. **Implement the rendering engine** ✅  
Written in Typescript using Three JS + WebGL, it should load and render complex 3D scenes and models, display fluid animations, play music and sound effects.

5. **Implement the Skills trainer** ✅  
Written in Rust using libtorch, it should train the bots using deep reinforcement learning, using the first game/engine as a base to teach the players the skills required to participate in matches.

6. **Implement the NFT generator** ✅  
Written in Rust, it should allow NFT creators to generate NAS-1 (Neural Arena Standard 1) NFTs with different 3d models, neural networks, properties and images, just by editing a config file and copying files to folders, without requiring any coding experience.
