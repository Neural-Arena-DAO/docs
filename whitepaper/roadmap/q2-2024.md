Neural Arena is being developed in "stealth mode" for more than a year. Now it's time to show it to the world! We will create accounts on Twitter and a channel in OpenChat, starting a thread at http://forum.dfinity.org/ about it, and build brand awareness.

4. **Open source all platform components**  
Before launching the SNS DAO, all the platform components, that's it, the backend and frontend canisters, Three JS rendering engine, the skills trainer and the NFT generator tools, must be released as open-source on github.

Create a NNS proposal, including all the relevant information.

After the SNS DAO is launched, a proposal to contract an auditing firm, with experience in Rust and on the Internet Computer, will be created. It should conduct an audit of the platform code.
