# Introduction

**Neural Arena** is a decentralized web3 game platform, pioneering a world-first approach where users deploy their **AI-enhanced NFT characters (AI players)** to compete against each other in matches to **improve their NFT's experience** (XP) and to **win prizes** in crypto.

Leveraging features only present on the **Internet Computer**, our platform runs game matches **fully on-chain**, with NFT players utilizing their "artificial brains" (**neural networks**) to play against one another.

In simple terms, Neural Arena is the ideal fusion of gaming, cryptocurrency, and AI. There's no hype, no false partnerships, no empty promises, no future plans of impossible to do AI on-chain, no "magic" web3 app that could work much better in web2.

## TL;DR

- Each **NFT** contains the visual features (the 3d model with animations) and the skills (the weights and bias of its **artificial neural network**) trained using **deep reinforcement learning** (RL). All the contents (the NN data, the 3d model and the sound effects) are **stored on-chain**.
- All games **run 100% on-chain** to ensure no match can be manipulated as there are no external interferences, making hacking impossible.
- The platform is **independent** of the games and NFT's hosted. Developers will soon be able to **publish their own games and NFT collections** using our Canister Development Kit (CDK) and our NFT generator.
- Neural Arena will be fully **open-source** upon the launch of its SNS Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).
