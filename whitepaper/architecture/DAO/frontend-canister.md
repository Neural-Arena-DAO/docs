# Frontend canister

The frontend canister, written in the Typescript language, is the UI component of the platform.

It is also entirely independent from the games and NFT's, allowing an unlimited number of them.

The website functions flawlessly across a range of devices, **from mobile phones to large screens**, ensuring that the platform can be accessed and games enjoyed on **any device**.

### Rendering engine

The frontend includes a rendering engine used to display the matches to users.

Built in Typescript using Three JS + WebGL (supported by any modern browser), at its current form, the engine has numerous features such as loading and rendering **complex 3D scenes and models**, showing **fluid animations**, **playing music and sound effects**.

In the **future**, it will also support **scripting** and other visual effects, such as a particle system.

The rendering engine is **compact and optimized**, allowing for **quick loading** of game assets even on mobile devices.
