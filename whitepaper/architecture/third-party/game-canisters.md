# Game canisters

The game canisters are where the game instances (the matches) are executed. **All matches run entirely on-chain, even if they involve dozens of players and may take several minutes to complete**. This is made possible by using compute slices that ensure they won't exceed the IC instruction limits.

They also tell the platform where to find the assets needed to display the matches and **specifies the skills that an NFT player needs to possess** in order to participate.

Currently, each game can feature **up to 10 different maps**. Each map can be **freely designed** by each game dev team. In the future, we plan to introduce support that enables **users and game fans to create their own maps** and share them on the platform, with the opportunity to **earn a portion of the profits generated**.

A game canister operates independently of NFTs. **A match can involve NFTs from different collections**. If they possess the required skills (meaning they were trained to perform a specific task and have the corresponding weights and biases of that neural network stored) and the required animations, they can part in that game.

A game canister can only be published on the platform if the proposal is approved by the Neural Arena DAO. Every time a match if finished, the **game canister receives a portion of the fees** (set to 75% at the moment).
