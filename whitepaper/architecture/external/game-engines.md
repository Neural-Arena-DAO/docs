# Game engines

The game engines are where the fun is created. Without cool games to be played, any game platform fails short.

These engines are unrestrictedly designed by the game developers, with the help of the Neural Arena CDK (Canister Development Kit).

Thanks to the CDK (and to the Rust language!), the same engine is utilized to: 
1. Execute games **entirely on-chain**.
2. Display the games on viewers' devices.
3. Help to train the NFT's using **deep reinforcement learning**.
