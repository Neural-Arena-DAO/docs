# Conclusion

While we embarked on the design and development of the platform with no guarantee of success, considering there's no precedent for Neural Arena on any existing blockchain, we've always believed in open-sourcing the application and placing it under DAO control.

Having transitioned from a concept to a functional web3 application, Neural Arena can now revolutionize the space, much like the Internet Computer did. We need your assistence to move it into production and showcase its potential to the crypto world.

Reiterating what we stated earlier: there are no empty promises, no false partnerships, no plans of impossible to do AI on-chain, no "magic" web3 app that could perform much better in web2, no token without utility. No fluff, just hard work.
