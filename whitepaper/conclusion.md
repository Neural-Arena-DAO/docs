# Conclusion

Since the beginning of the development of the platform, when we had no idea if our ambitious plans would work, as there's nothing close to Neural Arena in any blockchain we know, we always believed that the first and unique source of funds should come from a DAO launch. This ensures that tokens are not unfairly distributed to unknown investors or parties whose contributions to the project are always unclear to the public.

Together with the founding team, at genesis, the only owners of the platform will be the SNS swap participants and nobody else.

Reiterating what we stated earlier: there's no hype, no false partnerships, no empty promises, no future plans of impossible to do AI on-chain, no web3 "magic" app that could work much better in web2. No fluff, just hard work.
