# Conclusion

While we embarked on the design and development of the platform with no guarantee of success, considering there's no precedent for Neural Arena on any existing blockchain, we've always believed in open-sourcing the application and placing it under DAO control.

Having evolved from a concept to a operational web3 application, Neural Arena can become one of the top applications within the IC ecosystem. To achieve this, funding is essential to advance the development and complete the roadmap, showcasing its potential to the crypto world. 

Imagine a variety of games and NFTs flooding the platform, with countless players participating in matches every day. Let's work together to make this vision a reality!

Reiterating what we stated earlier: there are no empty promises, no false partnerships, no plans of impossible to do AI on-chain, no "magic" web3 app that could perform much better in web2, no token without utility. No fluff, just hard work.
