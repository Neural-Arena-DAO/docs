# DAO

## Reasons

Establishing the Neural Arena DAO is the most important event to guarantee both the development and growth of the platform for two main reasons:

### Build trustness

To become one of the top applications in the IC ecosystem, we believe that an app must be open-source and controlled by a DAO. Trusting your tokens to closed-source and single-entity controlled apps in an unregulated crypto world is extremely risky. In the case of Neural Arena, where ensuring that no manipulation occurs during matches is crucial, this becomes even more important.

### Team growth

The developer team dedicated considerable effort to research, design, and implement a platform that is, thanks to the IC features, pretty unique in the crypto environment. They funded themselves during this time without grants or funds from investors. To further advance the platform, complete the roadmap, and establish a recognized brand, the team must be expanded, which requires capital.

## Conclusion

Since the beginning of the development, when we had no idea if our plans would work, we always believed that the first and unique source of funds should come from a DAO launch. This ensures that tokens are not unfairly distributed to unknown investors or parties whose contributions to the project are unclear. 

Together with the founding team, at TGE, the only owners of the platform will be the SNS swap participants and nobody else!
