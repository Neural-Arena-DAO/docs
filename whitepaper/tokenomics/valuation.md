# Valuation and price range

With 35% of the total supply for sale, the range of both valuation (market cap) and price of each NAT token will be:

| Raised directly (ICP) | Raised NF (ICP) | Valuation (ICP) | Token price (ICP) | Valuation (USD) | Token price (USD) |
| --------------------: | --------------: | --------------: | ----------: | --------------: | ----------: |
| 150,000 | 65,000 | 614,285 | 0.00614 | $ 7,371,420 | $ 0.07371 |
| 300,000 | 65,000 | 1,042,857 | 0.01042 | $ 12,514,285 | $ 0.12514 |

Notes: 
1. Assuming 65,000 ICP as the Neuro Fund (NF) participation; however, this value can fluctuate daily and will only be known exactly when the swap ends.
2. Considering a ICP/USD ratio of $ 12,00
