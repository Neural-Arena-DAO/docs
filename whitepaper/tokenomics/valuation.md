# Valuation and price range

With 20% of the total supply for sale, the valuation (market cap) and price of each NAT token will be:

| Raised directly (ICP) | Raised NF (ICP) | Valuation (ICP) | Price (ICP) |
| --------------------: | --------------: | --------------: | ----------: |
| 100,000 | 65,000 | 825,000 | 0.00825
| 500,000 | 65,000 | 2,825,000 | 0.02825

Note: Assuming 65,000 ICP as the Neuro Fund (NF) participation; however, this value can fluctuate daily and will only be known exactly when the swap ends.
