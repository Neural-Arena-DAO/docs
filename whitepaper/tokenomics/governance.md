# Governance

## Overview

Anyone will be able stake NAT to earn new NAT in the form of voting rewards. Staking NAT will create a neuron that can vote on proposals that update, manage, and configure the platform. A neuron can also be configured to vote automatically by following other neuron.

The dissolve delay is the minimum time period over which a neuron owner locks up their staked NAT tokens.
