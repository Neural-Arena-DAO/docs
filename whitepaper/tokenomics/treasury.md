# Treasury

When the SNS decentralization sale finish, the DAO will be in control of a treasury composed by ICP (the proceeds from the sale) and $NAT tokens (the 61% of the total supply).

The treasury, stored in both the ICP ledger account and the $NAT ledger account of the DAO, will be allocated through proposals that must be approved by DAO members.

Some applications for the funds include:

### Token liquidity

To provide liquidity for trading $NAT, we will propose transferring NAT tokens and their equivalent ICP value from the treasury to multiple liquidity pools on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes).

### Compensations and expenses

As with any organization, the DAO will need to compensate its team of collaborators and developers, as well as cover operational and administrative expenses to maintain and expand the platform.

Each proposal should outline the activities, milestones, and resources required to achieve the goals. The initial plan is to propose budget allocations every 6 months.

The initial strategy involves allocating 80% of the ICP treasury over a **span of four years** to support the development and maintenance of the platform, marketing campaigns, and creation of games and NFTs owned by the DAO. We plan to allocate 30% in the first year to drive the initial growth of the app with the team expansion, gradually reducing to 25%, 15%, and finally 10% in the fourth year. By then, we hope that the revenue generated from app fees and DAO-owned games and NFTs will cover the ongoing expenses.

### Championships

When championships are implemented, the prize pools in $NAT for the winners can be constituted from the treasury.

### Grants

Game developers and NFT collection creators could also request grants in $NAT to assist with the advancement of their projects.

### Partnerships

The DAO could also propose rewarding partners, such as other web3 apps and social media influencers, that in return would assist in growing the brand name.
