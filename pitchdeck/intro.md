# Introduction

**Neural Arena** is a decentralized web3 game platform, implementing a world-first approach where users employ their **AI-enhanced NFT characters (AI players)** to compete against each other in matches to **improve their NFT's experience** (XP) and to **win prizes** in crypto.

Leveraging features only present on the **Internet Computer**, our platform runs game matches **fully on-chain**, with NFT players utilizing their "artificial brains" (**neural networks**) to play against one another.

In simple terms, Neural Arena is the ideal fusion of gaming, cryptocurrency, and AI. There are no empty promises, no false partnerships, no plans of impossible to do AI on-chain, no "magic" web3 app that could perform much better in web2, no token without utility.
