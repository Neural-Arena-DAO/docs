The Neural Arena core team, having received no seed funds or grants, currently consists of:

## **Andr√© Vicentini** - founder
With over 24 years of experience as a software developer, skilled in programming languages such as C, C#, Java, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity, and Motoko, along with an MBA in Project Management, his most notable open-source project is the FreeBASIC compiler, boasting over 1 million downloads in total, having seen collaboration from dozens of contributors from around the World and accumulating thousands of users over the years. He also achieved 5th place at the Dfinity Supernova hackathon in 2022, while he was still learning about Motoko and development of web3 apps on IC.
