# Problem Statement

- Centralized servers are **vulnerable to hacking** and **cheating**.
- Decentralized games often **suffer from high latency**, leading to **poor gameplay**.
- Many decentralized games on the Internet Computer (IC) are **too simple or just superficial**, with basic backends that **don't fully utilize IC's potential**.
- Most decentralized games are play-to-earn, making it **difficult to achieve any significant profit**.
