# Competition

At present, there is no other decentralized, fully on-chain gaming platform featuring AI-enhanced NFTs on any blockchain that we know of.

AI Arena, from ArenaX Labs, a gaming platform featuring PvP fighting games in which AI researchers collaborate with gamers to build AI-powered NFT characters, only stores the NFT (without any features) on Ethereum, running games off-chain, due Ethereum computation limits. They raised $6 million in January 2024, in addition to $5 million in seed funding in October 2021.
