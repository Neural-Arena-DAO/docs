# Q4 2024 (and after)

1. **Create a NFT marketplace**  
Due the NAS-1 (Neural Arena Standard 1) distinctive features, the best way to showcase the users' NFT would be create our own marketplace, where all NAS-1 compatible collections could be launched and listed.  
All the earnings with the marketplace will be owned by the Neural Arena DAO.

2. **Support ERC721 Ethereum token**  
With the IC HTTPS outcalls feature or with the Ethereum integration currently being implemented by Dfinity, the DAO and any NFT creator could release the collections on Ethereum (or on a L2 EVM chain).  
The NFT data (3d model, neural net etc) would still be stored on IC, just the smart contract would be on Ethereum or a L2, due the costs to store and retrieve data.  
With the liquidity of Ethereum and the volume of its NFT market, the NFT collections would be able reach users outside the IC community. For the first time, a ERC721 NFT could be used on-chain to play games, not just to be a basic JPG image.

3. **Add support to scripting**  
The rendering engine should support scripting (JS compiled to WASM) to enable games to use more complex visual effects and animations.

4. **Add support for championships**  
Users should be able to participate in championships, where bigger prizes will be distributed to the winners.
