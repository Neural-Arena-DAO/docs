# Q3 2024
1. **Expand the team**  
With the SNS DAO funds, we will be able to expand the team, hiring developers, 3d modelers and animators, and start a marketing department. With the new members, the first NFT and the first game can be polished and finished.

2. **Start partnerships**  
Promote the platform through game and crypto influencers in the social media channels to reach a wider audience.  
Initiate partnerships with game development teams and NFT publishers to attract third-party content creators to the platform.

3. **Release the first NFT**  
The first NFT, for now called "Brains", a collection of zombies obsessed with brains, will be released by the DAO itself.  
The code will be open-sourced when finished and will help other NFT creators to design their own collections.  
**The Neural Arena DAO will be the sole owner of the collection** (the canisters and the source-code) and all earnings will be transferred to its treasury.

4. **Publish the first game**  
The first game, currently called "Rusty Circuit", a collection of post apocalyptic arenas where the AI players compete fighting against NPC's, will be released by the DAO too.  
The code will be open-sourced when finished and will help other game developers to design their own games.  
**The Neural Arena DAO will be the sole owner of the game** (the canisters and the source-code) and all earnings will be transferred to its treasury.
