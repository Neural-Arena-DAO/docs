# Neural Arena Token

The ICRC-1 token, called NAT (Neural Arena Token), will be required to participate in matches and championships.

## Revenue distribution

After every match is finished, a portion of the token revenue from that match, specifically all NATs paid by players who participated in the match, is distributed as follows:

1. 60% is transferred to the game creator/owner.
2. 25% is awarded to the match's winner.
3. 10% is directed to the platform treasury.
4. 5% is burned to offset the annual NAT inflation.

## Cost to play

The fee charged for users to participate in a match is always determined by the game creator. This is because the game canister will utilize its Cycles (which must be purchased using ICPs) to cover the costs of running the matches on the Internet Computer. Depending on the complexity of the game, billions of instructions may need to be executed for each player until the match is concluded. Similar to web2, games should have the freedom to determine the amount they will charge their players.
