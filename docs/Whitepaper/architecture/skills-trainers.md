# Skills trainers

For an NFT player to learn a new skill, it must undergo training using a **machine learning algorithm known as deep reinforcement learning**.

While each NFT collection has the freedom to develop its own trainer for specific or unconventional skills, we will be **providing trainers for common tasks** such as seeking a target, hand-to-hand combat, etc. These trainers can be utilized by multiple NFTs, **simplifying the process for NFT creators** to publish new collections. As these trainers will be open-source, they can be customized and enhanced as desired.

A game creator can also utilize its game engine to train specific skills required for participation in their game's matches. They can then create their **own NFT collection or sell/distribute the training data** (the neural network weights and biases) to be used by a third-party NFT creators.

Currently training must be done off-chain until Internet Computer add support for **GPU subnets**. When on-chain training becomes feasible, we also plan to enable **users to teach their NFTs how to perform the tasks**, thereby allowing human assistance to create more advanced AI players.
