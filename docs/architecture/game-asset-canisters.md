# Game asset canisters

The identity

## Description

The game asset canisters are where the graphic and audio assets are stored. That includes **3d maps**, NPC **3d models**, **3d scenes** (intro screens etc), **songs**, **sound effects** and **scripts** (WIP).

Maps, scenes and 3d models are stored as **GLTF**, the file format supported by all modern 3d modelling software, including **Blender**.

Music and sound effects can be stored as **MP3 or OGG**.

Games can also choose to store assets outside IC if they wish, like IPFS, Arweave or even a CDN.
