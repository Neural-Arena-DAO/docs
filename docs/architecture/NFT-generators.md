# NFT generators

To make it easier to NFT creators to publish new collections, we will release a **tool to assist on generating the NFTs**.

If you've ever attempted to create a 2D NFT, you're likely aware of how challenging it can be to assemble all the necessary parts without resorting to some form of automation.

Adding 3d and neural networks to that formula, that task becomes much harder.

Our **open-source NFT tool** will enable creators to release their collections by editing simple configuration files and copying files to folders, **without requiring any coding experience**.

Additionally, each NFT collection is free to create their own generators or customize ours.
