# NFT asset Canisters

The graphic, sounds and skills

## Description

The NFT asset canisters are where the **3d models**, **animations**, **sound effects**, **properties** and, the most important, the **weights and bias of the neural network** of each trained skill (**the brain**) are stored.

An NFT can possess as many skills as necessary, enabling it to participate in various types of games (they also need to have to proper animations).

The 3d models can be freely designed by the NFT creators, allowing each NFT to be visually distinct. Models are stored as GLTF, the file format supported by all modern 3d modelling software, including Blender.

NFT collections can also choose to store assets outside IC if they wish, like IPFS, Arweave etc.
