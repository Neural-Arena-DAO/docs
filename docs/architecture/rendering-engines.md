# Rendering engines

Last but certainly not least, the rendering engines are used to display the matches to users.

Our engine, built upon the Three JS library using WebGL (supported by any modern browser), at its current form, has numerous features such as loading and rendering **complex 3D scenes and models**, showing **fluid animations**, **playing music and sound effects**.

In the **future**, it will also support **scripting** and other visual effects, such as a particle system.

The rendering engine is **compact and optimized**, allowing for **quick loading** of game assets even on mobile devices.
